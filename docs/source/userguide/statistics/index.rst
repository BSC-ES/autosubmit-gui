Autosubmit Statistics
=====================


When you click on the ``Statistics`` tab, you will see two input boxes: ``Section`` and ``Hours``, followed by the button ``Get Statistics``:

.. .. figure:: fig/fig_stat_1.jpg
..    :name: experiment_stats
..    :width: 100%
..    :align: center
..    :alt: Experiment Stat 1

..    Experiment Statistics

There is also a brief explanation of the input fields and expected result. Basically, ``Section`` allows you to narrow your search to certain job types, and ``Hours`` allows you to set a time limit to look into the past in hours.

In this example we have queried 3 hours into the past:
 
.. .. figure:: fig/fig_stat_2.jpg
..    :name: experiment_stats_open
..    :width: 100%
..    :align: center
..    :alt: Experiment Stat 2

..    Experiment Statistics (Last 3 hours)

Click on the button ``Clear Statistics`` to clear the results and submit another query.
